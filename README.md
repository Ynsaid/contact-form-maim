## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

<img src="./assets/images/screenshot.png" />

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
